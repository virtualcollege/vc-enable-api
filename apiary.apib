# Enable API
Enable API is a service for integrating with Virtual College's Enable platform. It is available at: https://external-api.vc-enable.co.uk/.

The Enable API can be used to retrieve information that is stored within Enable, as well as carrying out several actions.  See the documentation below for what is available via this API.  In the vast majority of cases, custom development work will be required to be carried out by customers to interact with this API.

The API is designed to be used by other pieces of software, with the aim to support integration with other systems.  Whilst the API can be used manually (via an interface such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)), we expect most users to have custom software written to call the API.  The API (or Enable) cannot communicate directly with other systems, but the API has been made available so other systems can make use of it and perform the required actions.

# Usage
Every request to the API must specify the following headers:
- x-api-version: Allows the server to determine what version of the API should be used
- x-api-nonce: Used to protect against replay attacks.  Every request must specify a nonce that is globally unique over a given period of time.  This has a max-length of 450 characters. We suggest using a GUID to ensure that the nonce is unique.

Requests to API functions which require the client to authenticate must also specify the following headers:
- x-api-access-token: Used to authenticate the client and verify the source of API requests

**Remarks**
- Any request that does not specify x-api-version will return a 400
- Any request that specifies an unexpected x-api-version will return a 404
- Any request that does not specify x-api-nonce will return a 400
- Any request that specifies a nonce that has been used previously will return a 401
- Any request that requires authentication but does not specify x-api-access-token or specifies an invalid token will return a 401
- Tokens use the JSON Web Token format (http://jwt.io)

# Group Security

In order to authenticate with the API a client must first request an authorisation token 
which must then be encrypted and signed using the client's secret key.  The encrypted 
payload must then be posted to the server to create an access token.

Access Tokens are time limited and will expire.  When creating an access token the server
will return a timestamp of when the token will expire.

## Authorisation Token [/authorisation-tokens/{domainReference}]
Endpoint to retrieve a single Authorisation Token for use in creating an Access Token

+ Parameters
    + domainReference (required, Guid) ... The reference of the domain the client is trying to authenticate against

### Create an Authorisation Token [GET]
+ Request (application/json)

    + Header
    
            x-api-version: 1.0
            x-api-nonce: 2147483647
            
+ Response 201 (application/json)

            }
            
+ Response 401

+ Response 404

## Access Tokens [/access-tokens]
Access tokens used to authenticate a client with the API.

The *signedAuthorisationToken* property is made up from the *authorisationToken* returned from the previous call, then encoded  using **JwtEncoder** as follows

``` 
    var data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Dictionary<string,string>>(signedAuthorisationToken);
    JwtEncoder encoder = new JwtEncoder(new JWT.Algorithms.HMACSHA512Algorithm(), new JsonNetSerializer(), new JwtBase64UrlEncoder());
    authToken = encoder.Encode(data, apiPublicKey);

```

where the *apiPublicKey* is the LMS public key.

# Group Users - SSO Authentication

SSO User related resources of the **Enable API**

**Who can use these endpoints?**

The endpoints in this section can only be used by customers that have Enable configured to authenticate users with:
+ AD FS
+ Azure AD

Customers using **Email Addresses** or **Usernames** authentication will receive a 403 Forbidden error, and the endpoints in the <a href="#reference/users-standard-authentication">Users - Standard Authentication</a> section should be used instead.


## Synchronise Users [/users/SSO]
Synchronises users from an external source into the LMS.

Accepts an array of user objects.  The "id" property is used to identify the user.

### Import users [POST]

The parameters are -
+ `id` *(required)* The id of the user.  For AD FS SSO, this should be the SID.  For Azure AD, this should be the object ID (oid).
+ `firstName` *(required)* The first name of the user.  Maximum 255 characters
+ `lastName` *(required)* The last name of the user.  Maximum 255 characters
+ `emailAddress` *(required)* The email address of the user.  Maximum 100 characters

+ `lineManagers` *(optional)* An array of Line Manager User Ids (SID/object ID) to associate with the user. Line Managers are only added to users via this call, not removed.  A user cannot be their own direct line manager.

If the user does not already exist, it is added.  If they already exist, they are updated.

Note: The system enforces uniqueness in the email address used and hence if the request for a new user has an email address, that is already used in the domain, an error message is returned.

Options are **all** to return all data, and **byUserFilter** to only return related data that matches the filter specified in the user filter.  For example, say a user has two module allocations from two different groups and the user filter is set to return just one of these groups.  The user will be included in the report regardless of the dataFilter; if 'all' is specified then the allocations for both groups the user is a member of will be included, however if 'byUserFilter' is specified then only the allocations relating to the specified group will be included.  This should be a **STRING**

Returns the reference of the created report, which is a **GUID**.  This reference is used in the endpoint to export the data.

### Add [POST]

The parameters are -
+ `name` *(required)* The name of the report.  Can be alpha-numeric, maximum 255 characters.  Must be a **STRING**
+ `includeInactiveUsers` *(optional, defaults to false)* When selected, inactive users are included.  This should be a **BOOL**
+ `userFilter` *(optional)* An object that specifies the filter that determines which users are included in the report.  This should be an **OBJECT**
+ `userFilter\filterType` *(required)* The type of user filter.  Options are **group** to filter by groups and **classification** to filter by classifications.  Must be a **STRING**
+ `userFilter\selected` *(optional)* A list of references to filter by, depending on what type is set in userFilter\filterType (when 'group' is specified this will be a list of group references, when 'classification' is specified this will be a list of classification references).  When this list is not specified or empty, then all groups/classifications will be included (for example, will return users that exist in any group or classification).  Must be an **ARRAY** of **GUID**
+ `dataFilter` *(optional, defaults to 'all')* The filter applied to related data in the report.  Options are **all** to return all data, and **byUserFilter** to only return related data that matches the filter specified in the user filter.  For example, say a user has two module allocations from two different groups and the user filter is set to return just one of these groups.  If a dataFilter of 'all' is specified then the allocations for both groups the user is a member of will be included, however if 'byUserFilter' is specified then only the allocations relating to the specified group will be included.  This should be a **STRING**
+ `selectedModules` *(optional)* A list of module references to filter by.  When this list is not specified or empty, then all modules will be included.  Must be an **ARRAY** of **GUID**

Returns the reference of the created report, which is a **GUID**.  This reference is used in the endpoint to export the data.

### Add [POST]

The parameters are -
+ `name` *(required)* The name of the report.  Can be alpha-numeric, maximum 255 characters.  Must be a **STRING**
+ `includeInactiveUsers` *(optional, defaults to false)* When selected, inactive users are included.  This should be a **BOOL**
+ `userFilter` *(optional)* An object that specifies the filter that determines which users are included in the report.  This should be an **OBJECT**
+ `userFilter\filterType` *(required)* The type of user filter.  Options are **group** to filter by groups and **classification** to filter by classifications.  Must be a **STRING**
+ `userFilter\selected` *(optional)* A list of references to filter by, depending on what type is set in userFilter\filterType (when 'group' is specified this will be a list of group references, when 'classification' is specified this will be a list of classification references).  When this list is not specified or empty, then all groups/classifications will be included (for example, will return users that exist in any group or classification).  Must be an **ARRAY** of **GUID**
+ `dataFilter` *(optional, defaults to 'all')* The filter applied to related data in the report.  Options are **all** to return all data, and **byUserFilter** to only return related data that matches the filter specified in the user filter.  For example, say a user has two module allocations from two different groups and the user filter is set to return just one of these groups.  If a dataFilter of 'all' is specified then the allocations for both groups the user is a member of will be included, however if 'byUserFilter' is specified then only the allocations relating to the specified group will be included.  This should be a **STRING**
+ `dateFrom` *(optional, **DATETIME**)*  Defaults to 1 month before the current date and time. Restricts the report data to evaluations that have been completed since this date.
+ `selectedModules` *(optional)* A list of module references to filter by.  When this list is not specified or empty, then all modules will be included.  Must be an **ARRAY** of **GUID**
+ `selectedEvaluations` *(optional)* A list of evaluation references to filter by.  When this list is not specified or empty, then all evaluations will be included.  Must be an **ARRAY** of **GUID**

Returns the reference of the created report, which is a **GUID**.  This reference is used in the endpoint to export the data.

The parameters are -
+ `name` *(required)* The name of the report.  Can be alpha-numeric, maximum 255 characters.  Must be a **STRING**
+ `includeInactiveUsers` *(optional, defaults to false)* When selected, inactive users are included.  This should be a **BOOL**
+ `userFilter` *(optional)* An object that specifies the filter that determines which users are included in the report.  This should be an **OBJECT**
+ `userFilter\filterType` *(required)* The type of user filter.  Options are **group** to filter by groups and **classification** to filter by classifications.  Must be a **STRING**
+ `userFilter\selected` *(optional)* A list of references to filter by, depending on what type is set in userFilter\filterType (when 'group' is specified this will be a list of group references, when 'classification' is specified this will be a list of classification references).  When this list is not specified or empty, then all groups/classifications will be included (for example, will return users that exist in any group or classification).

For example, say a user has two allocations from two different groups and the user filter is set to return just one of these groups.  If a dataFilter of 'all' is specified then the allocations for both groups the user is a member of will be included, however if 'byUserFilter' is specified then only the allocations relating to the specified group will be included.  This should be a **STRING**
+ `selectedEvents` *(optional)* A list of event references to filter by. When this list is not specified or empty, then all events will be included. Must be an **ARRAY** of **GUID**

+ `Number` - greaterthan, greaterthanorequalto, lessthan, lessthanorequalto, equals, notequalto, between, notbetween
+ `Date` - equals, before, from, between
+ `Duration` - greaterthan, greaterthanorequalto, lessthan, lessthanorequalto, equals, notequalto

Returned object -
+ `rows` The list of rows
+ `rows\cells` The list of cells within the row
+ `rows\cells\column` The readable name of the column
+ `rows\cells\columnInternalName` The system name of the column
+ `rows\cells\value` The value of the cell
+ `rows\cells\cellColor` The colour of the cell.  This will be an empty string when **hasCellColor** is false
+ `rows\cells\textColor` The colour of the text within the cell
+ `rows\cells\hasCellColor` Whether the cell has an associated colour

No results will return an object with an empty **rows** array.
